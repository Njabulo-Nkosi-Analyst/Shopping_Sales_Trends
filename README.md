# Shopping_Sales_Trends;Driving Growth - Sales Performance Review (Jan-Jun 2025)

## Aim
This project analyzes a Customer Shopping Preferences dataset to deliver data-driven recommendations.The goal is to optimize product offerings, refine marketing strategies, and ultimately enhance customer satisfaction and retention

## 📊 Dashboard Overview
This project features an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes key trends from a comprehensive customer shopping dataset. The dashboard is segmented into four main views:
1.  **Sales Overview:** Tracks core business KPIs like revenue and quantity sold, including monthly trends and top-performing locations.
2.  **Customer Demographics:** Provides a detailed breakdown of the customer base by age, gender, location, and spending habits.
3.  **Promotional Trends:** Analyzes the impact of discounts, shipping offers, and seasonal promotions on customer behavior.
4.  **Product Performance:** Details sales trends by category, size, and individual products.

   ## 💡 Key Insights
Analysis of the dashboard revealed several key insights into customer behavior:

1.  **Dominant Demographic:** **Women aged 26-59** are the core customer base, accounting for 68% of all customers and showing the highest concentration in the "Adults" age bracket.
2.  **Peak Shopping Times:** Sales activity surges mid-week and on weekends, specifically on **Wednesdays and Sundays**.The most profitable hours are in the **Evening (17:00-21:59)** and **Night (22:00-04:59)**.
3.  **Top-Selling Category:** **Clothing** is the undisputed leader, representing 45% of revenue.Within this category, **size Medium (M)** is the most purchased size, driving 45% of sales
4.  **Impact of Discounts:** Promotions are a major revenue driver. Items with a discount applied generate more revenue (**$134K**) than non-discounted items (**$99K**).

## 🚀 Business Recommendations

Based on the insights, the following actions are recommended to help the business grow:

* **Focus on the Core Audience:** Double down on marketing efforts aimed at adult women. Tailor product discovery, ad campaigns, and social media content to the preferences of this key demographic.
* **Optimize Timing for Promotions:** To combat the sales dip on Tuesdays, launch a **"Treat Yourself Tuesday"** weekly promotion. Schedule email and social media marketing pushes for late afternoons to capture customers ahead of the peak evening shopping window.
* **Strategic Inventory Management:** Ensure **Clothing** and especially **size Medium** products are well-stocked to prevent lost sales from stockouts. Feature these best-sellers prominently on the website and in marketing materials.
* **Develop a Tiered Customer Strategy:** Since customers are evenly spread across spending tiers, create targeted programs. Offer a loyalty club with exclusive sales for high spenders and promote value bundles to encourage repeat purchases from price-sensitive customers.
